<p>Access to Datica systems and application is limited for all users, including but not limited to workforce members, volunteers, business associates, contracted providers, consultants, and any other entity, is allowable only on a minimum necessary basis. All users are responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized user or access of the organization&rsquo;s information systems. These safeguards have been established to address the HIPAA Security regulations including the following:</p>

<h2 id="7-2-access-establishment-and-modification">7.2 Access Establishment and Modification</h2>

<ol>
<li>Requests for access to Datica Platform systems and applications is made formally using the following process:

<ol>
<li>The Datica workforce member, or their manager, initiates the access request by creating an Issue in the JIRA Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Project.

<ul>
<li>User identities must be verified prior to granting access to new accounts.</li>
<li>Identity verification must be done in person where possible; for remote employees, identities must be verified over the phone.</li>
<li>For new accounts, the method used to verify the user&rsquo;s identity must be recorded on the Issue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Security Officer will grant access to systems as dictated by the employee&rsquo;s job title. If additional access is required outside of the minimum necessary to perform job functions, the requester must include a description of why the additional access is required as part of the access request.</li>
<li>Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.</li>
<li>If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required. The Security Officer then grants requested access.

<ul>
<li>New accounts will be created with a temporary secure password that meets all requirements from <a href="#7.12-password-management">§7.12</a>, which must be changed on the initial login.</li>
<li>All password exchanges must occur over an authenticated channel.</li>
<li>For production systems, access grants are accomplished by adding the appropriate user account to the corresponding LDAP group.</li>
<li>For non-production systems, access grants are accomplished by leveraging the access control mechanisms built into those systems. Account management for non-production systems may be delegated to a Datica employee at the discretion of the Security Officer.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Access is not granted until receipt, review, and approval by the Datica Security Officer;</li>
<li>The request for access is retained for future reference.</li>
<li>All access to Datica systems and services are reviewed and updated on a bi-annual basis to ensure proper authorizations are in place commensurate with job functions. The process for conducting reviews is outlined below:

<ol>
<li>The Security Officer initiates the review of user access by creating an Issue in the JIRA Compliance Review Activity (CRA) Project.</li>
<li>The Security Officer, or a Privacy Officer, is assigned to review levels of access for each Datica workforce member.</li>
<li>If user access is found during review that is not in line with the least privilege principle, the process below is used to modify user access and notify the user of access changes. Once those steps are completed, the Issue is then reviewed again.</li>
<li>Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.</li>
<li>If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.</li>
<li>Review of user access is monitored on a quarterly basis using JIRA reporting to assess compliance with above policy.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Any Datica workforce member can request change of access using the process outlined in <a href="#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification">§7.2 paragraph 1</a>.</li>
<li>Access to production systems is controlled using centralized user management and authentication.</li>
<li>Temporary accounts are not used unless absolutely necessary for business purposes.

<ul>
<li>Accounts are reviewed every 90 days to ensure temporary accounts are not left unnecessarily.</li>
<li>Accounts that are inactive for over 90 days are removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the case of non-personal information, such as generic educational content, identification and authentication may not be required. This is the responsibility of Datica Customers to define, and not Datica.</li>
<li>Privileged users must first access systems using standard, unique user accounts before switching to privileged users and performing privileged tasks.

<ul>
<li>For production systems, this is enforced by creating non-privileged user accounts that must invoke <code>sudo</code> to perform privileged tasks.</li>
<li>Rights for privileged accounts are granted by the Security Officer using the process outlined in <a href="#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification">§7.2 paragraph 1</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All application to application communication using service accounts is restricted and not permitted unless absolutely needed. Automated tools are used to limit account access across applications and systems.</li>
<li>Generic accounts are not allowed on Datica systems.</li>
<li>Access is granted through encrypted, VPN tunnels that utilize two-factor authentication.

<ul>
<li>Two-factor authentication is accomplished using a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) as the second factor.</li>
<li>VPN connections use 256-bit AES 256 encryption, or equivalent.</li>
<li>VPN sessions are automatically disconnected after 30 minutes of inactivity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In cases of increased risk or known attempted unauthorized access, immediate steps are taken by the Security and Privacy Officer to limit access and reduce risk of unauthorized access.</li>
<li>Direct system to system, system to application, and application to application authentication and authorization are limited and controlled to restrict access.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="7-3-workforce-clearance">7.3 Workforce Clearance</h2>

<ol>
<li>The level of security assigned to a user to the organization&rsquo;s information systems is based on the minimum necessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user&rsquo;s job classification and/or to a user needing access to carry out treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.</li>
<li>All access requests are treated on a &ldquo;least-access principle.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Datica maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data. As such, Datica, including all workforce members, does not readily have access to any ePHI.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="7-4-access-authorization">7.4 Access Authorization</h2>

<ol>
<li>Role based access categories for each Datica system and application are pre-approved by the Security Officer or VP of Engineering.</li>
<li>Datica utilizes hardware and software firewalls to segment data, prevent unauthorized access, and monitor traffic for denial of service attacks.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="7-5-person-or-entity-authentication">7.5 Person or Entity Authentication</h2>

<li>Each workforce member has and uses a unique user ID and password that identifies him/her as the user of the information system.</li>
<li>Each Customer and Partner has and uses a unique user ID and password that identifies him/her as the user of the information system.</li>
<li>All Customer support desk interactions must be verified before Datica support personnel will satisfy any request having information security implications.

<ul>
<li>Datica&rsquo;s current support desk software, Zendesk, requires users to authenticate before submitting support tickets.</li>
<li>Support issues submitted via Datica&rsquo;s dashboard require that users authenticate with their Datica account before submitting support tickets.</li>
<li>Support issues submitted by email must be verified by Datica personnel using a phone number that has been registered with the corresponding account.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="7-6-unique-user-identification">7.6 Unique User Identification</h2>

<ol>
<li>Access to the Datica Platform systems and applications is controlled by requiring unique User Login IDs and passwords for each individual user and developer.</li>
<li>Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls (see below).</li>
<li>Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in plain text.</li>
<li>Default accounts on all production systems, including root, are disabled.</li>
<li>Shared accounts are not allowed within Datica systems or networks.</li>
